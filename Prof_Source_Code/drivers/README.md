# Lab 8: Potentiometer Chasing LEDs 

## C++ Main Application
Most of source code was provided - only had to create the application file. Most of the code is unchanged except for the addition of xADC and a potentiometer which controls the speed instead of switches. The initial switch still resets the LED to LED0.
