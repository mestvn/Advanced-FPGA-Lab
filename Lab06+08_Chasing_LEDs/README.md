# Lab 6: Chasing LEDs

# Lab 8: with Potentiometer

## C++ Application Lab 6:
Most of source code was provided - only had to create the application file. Consists of incrementing and decrementing for loops that have a smaller sleep period depending on the speed. UART transmission only occurs when the speed is changed.

## C++ Application Lab 8:
Most of the code is unchanged except for the addition of xADC and a potentiometer which controls the speed instead of switches. The initial switch still resets the LED to LED0.
