# Lab 12: Square Video Display Test

DEMO: https://youtube.com/shorts/NTxHoVp2KYU?feature=share

## C++ Main Application
Most of source code was provided - only had to edit the bar demo file. Instead of being bypasses, the 2 left-most switches control the size of the center square. Then, the 12 right-most switches control the RGB colors in the square with 4 switches for each color, respectively. The outside of the square is the complement color.
